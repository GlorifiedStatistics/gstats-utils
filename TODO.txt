Hashing:
- Make _raise_on_key_error and __str__ not take forever on large objects
- Make it so you can't call dict() functions for future-proofness.
- Add classmethods for larger mergings/operations on many dictionaries.
- Allow for lambda on_collision method
- Double check I've implemented all I need to
- Add in apply() and aggregate() functions? (possibly class methods apply_all() and aggregate_all())
- Allow for setting default values
- Add all of the functionality into the docstring

Other:
- Take notes on python typing
- Remember to use TypeGuard if needed
